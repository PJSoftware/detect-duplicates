# Progress Bar not Progressing

During the "Hashing" phase, the progress bar only seems to be updating intermittently, not with every file that is hashed.

* Appears to be an issue with git-bash on Windows. The bar runs smoothly in Windows DOS Command (`CMD.EXE`). Possibly git-bash is caching output?
* calling sys.stdout.flush() after printing the progress bar should do the trick. See [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34668972/cmd-and-git-bash-have-a-different-result-when-run-a-python-code).
