# Cache Hashes

We really need to cache our hash calculations. I can foresee the possibility of false positives arising through this approach, so some care needs to be taken to minimise that possibility -- maybe include path, size, and filestamp as identifiers -- but when it takes several hours to calculate all your hashes, you don't want to have to repeat the process!
