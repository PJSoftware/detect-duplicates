# Exit Cleanly on Cancel

If the user presses cancel while the program is running, we currently get a full stack dump. It would be preferable to intercept that and exit cleanly.

```dump

This should ideally include a summary of how much had been done, maybe a log of duplicates found so far, etc. We probably need a status data object to keep track of where we've gotten up to...
